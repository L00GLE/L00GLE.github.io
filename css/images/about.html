	<p>
		I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.
		<br>I originally intended to major in Graphic Design
		but took a year off to give computer programming
		a try.
		<br>I learned on my own, followed through some
		books, and video tutorials learning Python.
		<br>I later
		learned HTML and CSS to help build my first Portfolio
		website as well as develop some programs I thought
		would be cool to make.
		<br>I took the plunge, changed my
		major to Computer Science, and currently enjoying
		the expansion of my technical skill sets.
		<br>I look
		forward meeting new people and making applicable
		solutions for the betterment of myself and hopefully,
		some part of the world.
		<br>Pleasure to meet you!<br>
